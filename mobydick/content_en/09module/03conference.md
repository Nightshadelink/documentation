## Concept
If more than three people want to communicate with each other simultaneously, virtual conference rooms can be used.

A conference room is reachable under an extension number and in order to enter the conference room, simply dial the extension number and enter the required PIN number. 

If the extension number belongs to block of numbers (otherwise known as DIDs - Direct Inward Dial) from a voice Trunk, then the conference room will also be externally accessible.
