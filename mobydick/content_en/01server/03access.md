## Finding your System's IP Address
In order to access the system, you will require the IP address of the telephone system. The default IP address for a [pre-installed IP phone system](https://www.pascom.net/en/mobydick-classic/ "pascom VoIP phone systems"), (SOHO, SMB & Enterprise Servers) is 192.168.100.1 on the port as highlighted in the accompanying info sheet or labelled. If you are not sure about system's IP address, you can find it through using the mobydick text user interface TUI.

## Accessing the Web Interface
1. Use any web browser and access the system's interface by entering **https://[mobydick_IP_Address]** as the URL. Should you not use https, a warning will appear that informs you that the network connection is not encrypted.

To access the mobydick web UI per HTTPS, you must agree to a self-signed certificate.

2. Log into the web UI using the username `admin`and default password `mobydick` (should you have not entered a different password during the setup process).

Sessions remain active for 30 minutes of inactivity meaning new log in are required. Should you be working on a public computer, after finishing your work remember to log out of your mobydick commander session in order to prevent unauthorised access from other people. To do this simply click the `Logout` button.

## Accesing the TUI

The Text User Interface (TUI) allows you to adjust basic configurations, e.g. IP address and Host names etc. To use the TUI, please connect a display to your mobydick server, mobydick Appliance or mobydick server or refer to the virtual machine console. The screen will show you your network card IP addresses which can be configured under ***Configure Network***.

### Start Screen

## Access per SSH

To use SSH when accessing mobydick, please follow these steps mentioned below:

1. Start an SSH client of your choice. For Windows, we recommend using PuTTY. More information can be found at [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ "putty information").
2. Enter the predetermined IP address as the host address.
3. Log in as user **admin** and the default password **mobydick** or the password you chose during setup.
4. To log in as user **root**, enter the command **su** - and the password you chose.

## Accessing the Asterisk CLI
mobydick uses Asterisk Telephony Software as its basis. Asterisk offers a CLI (Command Line Interface) in which you can monitor and debug all telecommunications traffic as long as you are a root user and logged in using SSH. At the command prompt, enter ` asterisk -r`.
