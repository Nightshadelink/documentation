## SStatistics & Details

### Statistics (1)
Im mobydick Client können Sie die Echtzeitdaten Ihrer Teams direkt anschauen. Außerdem sehen Sie die Daten rückwirkend bis zu 1,2,4 oder 8 Stunden. Sie können 2 unterschiedliche Diagramme ansehen.

#### Agents Overview

![Screenshot - chart for agents](../../images/client_teams_statistics.png?width=80% "chart for agents")

From the above the chart, you can see when your agents are engaged or free as well as being able to identify when your team requires additional agents due to insufficient agent availability etc.

#### Calls Waiting Overview

![Screenshot - chart for waiting](../../images/client_teams_statstics_callswaiting.png?width=80% "chart for waiting")

The Calls Waiting option displays how many calls are currently waiting to be connected within the team. Once a waiting call within the Team/Queue has been answered and there are no more callers waiting within this queue the number of calls will reset to zero.

### Agents (2)

![Screenshot - chart for waiting](../../images/client_teams_agent_status-01.png?width=80% "chart for waiting")

By Clicking on the Agents Menu Tab, you will see a list of all team members, which will provide with the following information:
1. Which Agents are Logged in
2. Which Agents are paused
3. Which Agents are logged out (inactive)

### Calls Waiting (3)

Under the Calls Waiting menu tab, you can see all the information concerning callers who are currently waiting in the teams queue:

* Which position the caller is in
* Their name (should an existing Telephone book entry exist)
* Their Phone number
* How long they have been waiting

## Setting Pause / Break Reasons
In teams within which you can dynamically log in or out of, you can also set pause reasons which will temporarily log you out of the team. 
This function can be used for evaluation purposes and is helpful when an agent requires time "Post Processing" (So Paperwork etc relating to a call etc). 
The reasons for pausing can be predefined and rolled out by your administrator. In order to activate a pause reason, click on the pause symbol and select a reason from the drop down list.
