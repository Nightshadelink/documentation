## What is the TAPI?
The Microsoft **T**elephony **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface is a interface from the 1990s with which any number of applications are able to communicate with phone systems (telephones respectively) via an unified interface, without having exact knowledge relating to the functions of the connected phones. Microsoft has made a set of uniform functions available, which along with the applications (e.g. Outlook, PhoneSuite CTI Client) as well as the phone system developer (mobydick TAPI driver) will need to be implemented. 

the mobydick TAPI driver is in this respect not a stand alone programme, but rather dynamic libary (DLL) which is either loaded or unloaded according to requests from the Microsoft-TAPI-Server (Telefoniedienst) 

![Illustration - Tapi Concept](../../images/tapi_driver.png?width=70% "What is the TAPI?")


The mobydick TAPI can be installed on all windows workstations. The TAPI registers itself with the server using the same user data as the mobydick client. The TAPI is therefore not connected directly to the telephone but rather to the user. Should the TAPI send a dial command to mobydick then mobydick will automatically search for the current phone being used by the user and uses this to make the call. Should the user change work location or telephone, the TAPI does not need to be reconfigured.

## TAPI and the mobydick Client

The mobydick TAPI can be installed on any windows desktop. The TAPI will then register itself with the server using the same credentials as the mobydick Client, which means the TAPI is assigned to a user rather than being directly connected to a telephone. When a dial command is sent to Mobydick via TAPI, mobydick will automatically select the current phone of the user and use this phone to make the call. If the user then changes their location or phone, the TAPI will not require any reconfiguration.


### When to use ...
#### .. the mobydick Client?

* When you want a complete overview of your colleagues presence info

### Installation on a Terminal Server

#### Configuration of the mobydick
Should you wish to install the TAPI on a Terminal Server or on a computer that is used by more than one person, then you will need assign the users, who will connect using the TAPI, with the ***xmpp.supervisor Role***. This means that only one individual XMPP connection will be constructed from the Terminal Server, over which the total communication will be transmitted.

![Screenshot - Successful Installation](../../images/tapi_terminalserver_concept.png?width=50% "Successful TAPI installation")


#### Installation

{{% notice note %}}
The setup requires administrative rights for the corresponding server. From Windows Server 2008 onwards, the system will automatically ask for the appropriate login, however, if you are using Windows Server 2003 you will need to login using the appropriate identifier first.{{% /notice %}}

Start the setup using the previously downloaded file:

Accept the Terms and Conditions:

All the necessary components will now be installed

After the installation has been successfully completed, you will need to configure the connection of the TAPI to mobydick

As stated before, the TAPI will login with the same user data just like the mobydick Client. 

|Variable| Description |
|---------|------------|
|Username |username|
|Password |users´ password|
|mobydick Server| IP number or hostname of the mobydick Server|

Now a further dialogue  box will appear, in which you will be able to select the users, who should be available later within TAPI applications (e.g. MS Outlook). All the existing users will be displayed within the list. In order to choose a user, one can double click on the desired user or use the buttons in between the two list screens:

You can now confirm the successful installation by clicking on **Finish**:

### Example scenario with Microsoft Outlook

Start Outlook and select the desired contact entry. Using the right mouse button, select the number to call from the drop down menu:  

Now the New Call window will appear: confirm the number by clicking ***Start call***.  

Now your telephone should make the call.

{{% notice info %}}
On terminal server installations, every user must select their "own" line within the TAPI Software (e.g. MS Outlook), before they will be able to complete a call using their phone.
{{% /notice %}}

By clicking **Dial Options** you can select line to be used:


### Unattended (Silent) Installation

It is also possible to install the TAPI without needing any GUI interaction. In order to do this, the installations programme must be called up using the following options:

    md-tapi-setup-2.00.00.R.exe /S /options=username:password:server.domain.tld

    Example:
    md-tapi-setup-2.00.00.R.exe /S /options=mmuster:123456789:mobydick.example.com

If the TAPI user has the ***xmpp.supervisor*** **Role**, all available users will be automatically selected and will then be available within the TAPI application.

## TAPI Debugging
If you uncover a problem when using the TAPI Driver, you can use this manual to start a TRACE, which can then be analysed by pascom and helping in finding a solution.

### Preparation
In order to record the TAPI debug output, you will need the DebugView tool from Microsoft/Sysinternals which can be downloaded here:
 https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896647.aspx
In addition, it is often also a good idea to record the call construction by using the tool "Tapi Master Line Watcher"( http://www.tapimaster.eu/de/leitungsbeobachter.htm) in parallel to the Debug tool
{{% notice warning %}}
Please note: Should programme behaviour change as a result of the Line Watch tool, then complete the debugging **without** it.
{{% /notice %}}

### Install the mobydick TAPI Driver in the Debug-Version

In order to be able to record Debug Output, the debug version of the mobydick driver must be installed. Whether you have the productive or debug version installed can be easily identified using the configurations dialog.

1. Go to the command panel > telephone and modem

2. Go to the "Advanced" Tab

3. Select the entry "mobydick TAPI Service Provider"

![Screenshot - mobydick TAPI Service Provider](../../images/tapi_config_phone.png?width=60% "mobydick TAPI Service Provider")

4. Click Configure
5. If the in following mask, the warning "WARNING: DEBUG VERSION INSTALLED" appears, then clearly the Debug-Version is installed

{{% row %}}
{{% col md-6 %}}
![Screenshot - logon tapi](../../images/tapi_config_mtapi.PNG?width=70% " logon tapi") 
{{% /col %}}
{{% col md-6 %}}
![Screenshot logon tapi Debug](../../images/tapi_config_mtapi_debug.PNG?width=70% " Logon tapi Debug")
{{% /col %}}
{{% /row %}}

Should you still not be certain, then please close all programmes and run the setup again. Please take note of the installation notices and during the installation select, "Debug" and confirm this by clicking next.
![Screenshot - TAPI installation instructions](../../images/tapi_mtapi_debug.png?width=60% "TAPI installation instructions")
This will replace any productive versions installed with the Debug version

### Preforming a Debugging

You now have all the necessary components downloaded and installed, so start the required tools

#### Open DebugView
<!--//FixME Run As Admin Image EN-->
