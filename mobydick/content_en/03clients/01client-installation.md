### Configuration

#### mobydick Client Login
After installing mobydick, the Role **All Users** contains the roll type "xmpp.group" as standard. This allows every user to log into the mobydick client using their **Username** and **Password**. Should you wish to restrict this behaviour, then you will need to remove access to the role type All Users and create a new role.

You are also able to create multiple roles, for example should you wish to create groups in which members can use the mobydick client to communicate only with one another.

Should a user be a member of multiple groups, then they will be able to toggle through each contact list within the client as shown below:
