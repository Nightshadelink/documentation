## Concept

The mobydick SIP Provider Database is a database of approved VoIP Providers and associated configurations templates.

{{% notice info %}} 
If you are connecting to an ISDN or Analog Trunk, you will first need to configure the Gateway before using the corresponding trunk template contained within the database.

## SIP Provider Database
mobydick comes complete with a selection of Approved SIP Provider Configurations Templates which have been fully tested to ensure interoperability and compatibility with the mobydick phone system. By choosing one of these approved providers, mobydick phone system administrators are able to benefit from not only ensured interoperability but also significant time saving benefits when connecting to their VoIP Service Provider. 

The mobydick SIP Provider Database is an ongoing project and is therefore constantly growing and (almost) every mobydick phone system release will contain new providers as interoperability testing is completed by our development team. Of course if your desired provider is not yet listed, don't worry as you will still be able to manually add and configure your provider settings and call rules. 

If you represent a provider and would like to become mobydick Certified and be added to our database, please complete the form on our Join our Expert Network Partner page and select Interoperability Partner within the formula as shown below:
