## Overview

[Snom M700] (https://www.snom.com/ip-phones/workplace-mobility/m700-multi-radio-base-station/ "Snom DECT Workplace mobility solutions") base stations can be operated in both Single Cell and Multi-Cell deployments and are compatible with pascom cloud, hardware and [virtual phone systems](https://www.pascom.net/en/mobydick-virtual/). As such the Snom M700 is ideally suited for organisations that require additional [work place mobility] (https://www.pascom.net/en/features/ "pascom workplace mobility features") over multiple floors or across larger company buildings.

### Preparation

For the automatic commissioning of Snom DECT systems, a functioning DHCP server is required. For more information, please refer to [DHCP Server Configuration](https://www.pascom.net/en/documentation/mobydick/server/network-configuration/#dhcp-server-configuration "DCHP Server Configuration").

## Configuration
Connect all required Snom base stations to your network. Once the boot process is completed, base stations will automatically appear in the PBX web UI Gateway list ('Gateways' > 'Gateway list'):

The **Status** field currently has no relevance and the "plug symbol" warning is normal at this stage.

### Configuring Multi-Cell Operation
Should you wish to network multiple Gateways into a multicell DECT system, simply mark and select all the desired Gateways and click **Edit**. By using the arrow buttons, you can navigate through all your selected Gateways and then edit them as follows. 

Under the `Mutli Cell` option, select the value `Base Station` for one of the Gateways and for all other Gateways, select the option `Repeater`.

### Add / Assign Handsets
Under`Devices` > `Device List` > `Add`, select the option `Via snom DECT Gateway: handset

ÃŒn the next screen, you will be able to configure the device and under the `Assignment` tab you will be able to assign users and / or locations.
