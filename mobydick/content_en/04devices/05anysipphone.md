## Setup IP Phones & Softphones - Generic Vendors

{{% notice tip %}}
mobydick offers Out-of-the-Box telephony thanks to incorporating a fully integrated softphone Windows, MacOSx and Linux. The softphone is automatically deployed with the mobydick desktop client. More information can be found under mobydick [Desktop Client User Guide]({{< relref "02client-user.md" >}})

mobydick is designed to be compatible with every SIP enabled device. Compared to devices from the vendors Snom, Yealink, Auerswald, Aastra and OpenStage, all other SIP devices are not automatically provisioned by mobydick. Therefore, all other SIP devices will not be automatically added to the device list and a SIP peer will not be automatically added.

In order to register a softphone or another IP telephone with mobydick, press `+Add` in the device list and choose **IP telephone: any manufacturer or softphone** as the device type:

Next, setup a **Username** and **Password** for the device:

Use this **Username** and **Password** to register the device with the mobydick software (in this example, we are using the Bria softphone from CounterPath):

Next, you will need to continue with adding [Users and User Locations]({{< relref "02user.md" >}}).
