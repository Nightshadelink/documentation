### 2. Select usage Variant and create Telephone System
Have you already decided how you want to operate your pascom telephone system? You have several options here. Tip !: Keep it simple and create a cloud telephone system. Perhaps you want to be your own master of your telephone system - with an on-site telephone system.

## Set up your pascom Telephone System

At this point your pascom telephone system has been created and is ready for use. Now, step by step, start setting up your business communication needs. But what is the best thing to do first? To keep the overview, continue to follow our guide.


### 3. Trunk Setup.

The next step is to configure your Trunk on the pascom telephone system so that your telephone system can be reached and of course you can also use it to make calls. To do this, take the user data of your provider that you need for the setup.

**Make it easier for you to set up your trunk by bringing along or choosing a provider that is supported by the pascom system with a predefined trunk template.**

**Test your Trunk!**<br/>

### 4. Create Users

Since you can now make calls with the pascom system, it makes sense to bring your users into the system. You are spoiled for choice here. Create users manually or automate the integration with a connector import. Think about which users should be assigned which roles.

<a href="https://www.pascom.net/doc/en/user/user/" title="create users" alt="pascom free cloud PBX edition" target="_blank" ><img src="add_users.en.png" style="width:200px; height: auto;" ></a>
</div>

##### You have even more options:
- Invite new Users into the pascom Telephone system.
- Maintain and import users via a [XLSX-Excel List]({{<ref "/user/user-import-xlsx">}}).
- Import Users via [Active Directory]({{<ref "/user/active-directory">}}).
- Import Users from a [LDAP-Directory]({{<ref "/user/ldap">}}).
<br>  

### 5. Setup Endpoints and assign to Users

Your users have been created. Some may already be using the pascom client's integrated softphone. However, some users prefer hardware phones at their workplaces. If possible, use telephone manufacturers that are supported by the pascom telephone system to simplify the **setup process** and to use the **CTI functions** provided by pascom on the telephones.

<br>

### 6. Configure Teams (Queues)

Queues are an integral part of a professional business communication environment these days. At pascom you divide your users into teams and are able to queue for e.g. sales, support, headquarters etc. All members of these teams will then be able to take calls from these queues.

<br>


### 7. Plan and implement your Callflow

You have probably already thought about what should happen if e.g. Agents are unreachable or your customers are in a crowded queue. The exciting part begins here, by planning your business communication process and implementing it on the pascom telephone system with the help of actions. Create an overview of your callflow so that you can visually record which route the callers are taking through your telephone system.


**Example**
![Actions](actions_example_en.png)


Once your planning has been completed, get started and place actions where they make sense. Announcements, discards and forwardings can be set up easily with parameters according to your requirements.

<br>

<br>


### 8. Callflow - Styling

Pick up your customers and inspire your callers with your own announcements and music on hold. Styling elements are the hallmark of your company and nothing is more important than the first impression you give. Let your callers know where they actually are, accentuate waiting times with relaxed music or set text messages to inform your customers.
 


<br>

<br>


### 9. Actions combined with Conditions

Are you still switching to forwarding with a midday announcement by hand during your lunchtime? Actions with conditions can help you not only in this case, but also if you want to take action at certain times or calendar days. And this fully automated!
Link actions with conditions and, for example, leave callers in the queue with a welcome announcement during your business hours and forwarding to the voicemail box outside your opening hours. Once set up, you no longer have to worry about it.

<br>
<a href="https://www.pascom.net/doc/en/acd/conditions/" title="conditions setup" alt="pascom free cloud PBX edition" target="_blank" ><img src="conditions.en.png" style="width:200px; height: auto;" ></a>
<br>

### 10. Expand your Callflow

Now that you're familiar with call actions, you can go one step further and create an even better calling experience for your customers. Integrate IVR menus into your call flow for targeted call control to guide your customers exactly where they want to go. Set up direct dial switches that start or stop certain actions when activated. Group actions and structure them in call distributors who pass through callers, react to certain actions and then act accordingly.
</br>  
##### More Information:
- Setup a [IVR Menue]({{<ref "/acd/ivr">}}).
- [Call Distributor]({{<ref "/acd/conditions#using-extension-switches" >}}) usage.

## Final Word

Every beginning is difficult, especially if you have your own implementation issues in mind that need to be set up as quickly as possible. Deal with the matter and you will shortly be able to successfully implement all your business communication requirements on the pascom telephone system.
