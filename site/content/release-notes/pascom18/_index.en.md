## Highlights

{{< youtube nE3SCcMVfto >}}

### Platform Unify 

The pascom classic and cloudstack have been unified into one platform. This ensures that all "cloud" functions such as encrypting of all calls and the simple integration of mobile users are also available in on-premise installations.

### Session Border Controller

The pascom Session Border Controller is now a fixed component of the pascom phone system solution and enables the integration of mobile users via SIP. 

### Enhance Audio Quality

All pascom Clients now offer an enhanced audio quality thanks to the integration of the OPUS codec. This is particularly beneficial for mobile users who could be in weaker networks. 

### Cloud VPN Connector 

The pascom.cloud can now also access local services such as Active Directory, CRM System, etc. in that you can now establish a direct VPN connection between your pascom.cloud instance and your company network.

### Remote Control of Desktop Phones via the Cloud

With pascom 18, the pascom Dekstop Client is now able to talk to directly hardware phones. As such you are able to enjoy the same comfort levels as on-premise solutions when using a pascom.cloud solution.

### Introduction of the pascom Mailserver cloudmx

Starting now, we are providing all pascom customers with the ability to send e-mails using our "cloudmx" service. Complicated integrations of local mail servers can now be avoided for both cloud and on-premise solutions.

### Encryption Made Simple

Thanks to the Let's Encrypt integration it is now very simple to use secure certificates.

## Core Changes

With pascom 18 there are a number of core changes that you will need to check before updating and then modify once you have updated. Please use our check list in our detailed [Upgrade Guide]({{ ref "/server/upgrade" }}).

### pascom Classic Client

The pascom Classic Client and the FlexPanels are no longer supported by pascom 18. FlexPanels will be improved and enhanced for both desktop and mobile clients with pascom 19.

### Discontinued Patton Support

Patton Gateways are no longer supported. Should you still have ISDN deployed, you should consider switching to a SIP connection. If you use Patton Gateways for analog fax devices etc., the  [Grandstream ATA Apapter]({{< ref "/gateways/grandstream" >}}) an ideal, cost effective alternative. 

### Discontinued Siemens Unify optiPoint Support

Due to non-existing encryption for voice and provisioning, Siemens Unify optiPoint endpoint support has been discontinued.

### Discontinued Cisco SPA 112 Support

Due to the Cisco SPA 112 gateway limitations that require a Cisco certificate, support has been discontinued in pascom 18.
