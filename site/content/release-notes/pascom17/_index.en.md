The update will break an environment with Aastra or Mitel DECT RFPs                           
Ensure to do the following before the update to this version:<br><br>
  - Update your Aastra DECT RFP to firmware 7.0SP1 or greater.                                              
  - Use the OM configurator tool to configure the previously used IP as static IP for the RFP (serves as OMM)            
  - Enter the provisioning URL to the DECT gateway and reboot it

**Important Notice:**              
- Even if mobile phones have previously been used in combination with a pascom phone system, after updating to pascom 17.00 or higher versions the mobile hub must be reconfigured.    
- All previously used mobile phones will remain in the configuration, but must be newly configured via the pairing process. It is possible to allow end users to perform the pairing process themselves, otherwise the process is only possible via the admin Web UI.      
- The new mobile app mobile app is only compatible with pascom phone system servers from version 17 onwards. The older mobile apps can continue to be used for older systems.       
- The new mobile app SIP softphone functionality is only compatible with pascom 17 Cloud phone systems.      
- The community version includes functionality for the new mobile app, but can not send any PUSH notifications. Therefore, you are only reachable per chat messages when the app is active in the foreground. Calls will be forwarded over GSM just as with the previous classic mobile app.     
- After a cloudstack update, you should configure your Proxy to include the new options for mobile phone pairing. Only activate these settings for the Proxy that is accessible from the Internet.        
- After a cloudstack update, please refresh your license in order to activate the PUSH functionality.         
- The FollowMe system for pascom softphones and mobile devices is now end-user configurable per default.
