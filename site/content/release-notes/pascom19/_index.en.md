### Screensharing

### pascom Groups with Audio, Video and Chat

Further enhance team collaboration with team messaging / team chat. Building on our “on the fly” group chat, with pascom 19 it is now possible to add “always-on” team messaging channels. Break down information silos by grouping users into departments, teams or projects and enable them to brainstorm ideas, share files and dynamically start audio / video conferences and desktop sharing sessions.

## Breaking Changes

{{% notice changes %}} 
This section explains the changes that you must consider when migrating to pascom 19
{{% /notice %}}

* **Snom Pickups** where changed to `EXTENSION|*8` syntax. See [Snom Desktop Phones]({{< ref "/endpoints/snom#function-keys" >}}).
* **Trunk Failover** deleted without alternative tools. No migration and no direct workaround. Support can help with an outbound script, if needed.   
* **IAX trunks** deleted without alternatives.   
* **Swap** is now disabled by default. This can break virtualised setups with memory lower then 1 GB, please configure more memory in this case.  
* **Call groups** are automatically converted to teams. The callgroup feature has been removed and customers should configure teams instead.  
* Port forwarding for **UDP 3478** is now mandatory, otherwise **video** tools will not work.
* A new provisioning is required for **beronet Gateways**.
