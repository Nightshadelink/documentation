### pascom Video Conferencing 

55 % of communication is visual so add the personal, visual element to your face-to-face video meetings. With pascom’s native video conferencing suite, starting a video conference from your desktop, mobile device or in a huddle room is as simple as clicking a button and there’s no need for any additional software and avoids any browser compatibility issues.

### Screensharing

A picture says a thousand words and with pascom 19, adding yet more visual aids to your team collaboration and meetings is just a click away. The new screen sharing functionality is available on all devices and platforms to ensure that even remote workers are able to view shared presentations and share their own screens.

### pascom Groups with Audio, Video and Chat

Further enhance team collaboration with team messaging / team chat. Building on our “on the fly” group chat, with pascom 19 it is now possible to add “always-on” team messaging channels. Break down information silos by grouping users into departments, teams or projects and enable them to brainstorm ideas, share files and dynamically start audio / video conferences and desktop sharing sessions.

{{% notice changes %}} 
This section explains the changes that you must consider when migrating to pascom 19
{{% /notice %}}

* **Snom Pickups** where changed to `EXTENSION|*8` syntax. See [Snom Desktop Phones]({{< ref "/endpoints/snom#function-keys" >}}).
* **Trunk Failover** deleted without alternative tools. No migration and no direct workaround. Support can help with an outbound script, if needed.   
* **IAX trunks** deleted without alternatives.   
* **Swap** is now disabled by default. This can break virtualised setups with memory lower then 1 GB, please configure more memory in this case.  
* **Call groups** are automatically converted to teams. The callgroup feature has been removed and customers should configure teams instead.  
* Port forwarding for **UDP 3478** is now mandatory, otherwise **video** tools will not work.
