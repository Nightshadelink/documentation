## What is a CSP?

CSPs are pascom partners who **themselves** offer or want to offer their customers pascom as a **hosted PBX solution**. The pascom server is **Multi-tenant / multi-instance** and **multi host** enabled and is therefore the ideal platform for hosted / cloud service providers.

## When will pascom 18 be available for CSPs?

Currently, CSPs still use pascom 17. In the very near future, the new pascom 18 platform will be available to you. Further information regarding the migration etc will follow shortly.
