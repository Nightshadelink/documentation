### Modify your Firewall

Many companies have **no Internet access restrictions** and can therefore **immediately** start using your **pascom appliance** without needing to make any alterations to their Firewall.

However, should you choose to, you can specify which internet services your company network is permitted to access by opening the following ports and allowing the pascom appliance access in order to ensure that your pascom phone system operates optimally:

#### pascom Services

| Port | Host | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------ |
| TCP **80**/**443** | my.pascom.net | Access to the pascom licence server + PUSH services |
| TCP **25** | cloudmx1.pascom.net, cloudmx2.pascom.net | Access to the pascom Mailserver |
| UDP **123** | \* | Access to the preferred time server (NTP) |
| UDP **3478** | \* | Access for Video-Functionality |

### {{< num 2 >}} Copy Server-ISO

Now copy the server ISO directly to the USB stick and rename it to **pascom.iso**.

### {{< num 3 >}} Create Configfile

Create the file **setup.json** directly on the USB stick with the following content:

```
{
    "device": "sda",
    "skipWelcome": true,
    "skipDevice": true,
    "skipHostname": true,
    "hostname": "usbsetup",
    "skipNetwork": true,
    "skipStartNetwork": true,
    "skipBrowser": true,
    "skipReboot": true,
    "halt": true,
    "preinst" : {
 
    }
}
```

### {{< num 4 >}} Connect, install and remove the USB stick

Den so vorbereiteten **USB-Stick** können Sie nun direkt an den **USB3-Port** (Rückseite, blauer Port) anstecken. Schließen Sie die Appliance an Bildschirm und Strom und schalten diese ein. Das Setup läuft automatisch durch. Nach erfolgreichem Setup schaltet sich die Appliance selbst ab. 

The **USB stick** prepared in this way can now be connected directly to the **USB3 port** (rear, blue port). Plug the appliance into screen and power and turn it on. The setup will run automatically. After successful setup, the appliance shuts itself off.

## Setup Mobile Acces via the Internet (optional)

{{% notice note %}}
If you want to use this feature, follow these steps now. Future changes are possible, but will result in changes for your users as aspects such as access to the server via the pascom client will change from a local IP address to a DNS name. 
{{% /notice %}}

This step is required should you wish to use the pascom mobile client (iOS/Android) or desktop client to access the local pascom server from "on the go" i.e. outside of the network.
