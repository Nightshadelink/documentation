**NO SUPPORT FOR PASCOM 18 AND NEWER** - pascom 18 and newer uses modern Linux kernel versions as a basis. These lead to incompatibilities or crashes on some SOHO server versions. With pascom 18 and newer we therefore recommend a hardware upgrade to the [pascom Appliance]({{< ref "server/appliance" >}}).
