## Overview

The Desktop client consists of three main components:

+ On the left hand side of the client, you will find your profile section, UC functions selector and contact list.
+ The right hand side is dedicated to telephony functions
+ The middle section is a flexible content area that changes depending on which UC tool is currently selected, i.e. Instant Messaging (Chat), Call History or Phone Books.

![Client Expanded Mode](expanded_mode.en.png)

The desktop client also offers differing view modes:

+ **Expanded Mode**: Displays all three components, of which the middle section can be selected using the UC tool toggle list.
+ **Normal Mode**: The user profile and contacts are visible as well as it being possible to switch between the *Chats, Telephony, Call History,* and *Phone Book* tools.
+ **Mini Mode**: Only a single area is visible and the UC tool selector menu is now found under the content area. Using the selector tool, it is possible to navigate through all UC tools, changing the visible content area as you go.

In order to simplify switching the various views, it is possible to toggle the sizes using a [shortcut key]({{< relref "#shortcut-keys">}}) if you choose to.
