## Overview

The Desktop client consists of three main components:

+ On the left hand side of the client, you will find your profile section, UC functions selector and contact list.
+ The right hand side is dedicated to telephony functions
+ The middle section is a flexible content area that changes depending on which UC tool is currently selected, i.e. Instant Messaging (Chat), Call History or Phone Books.

![Client Expanded Mode](expanded_mode.en.png)

The desktop client also offers differing view modes:

+ **Expanded Mode**: Displays all three components, of which the middle section can be selected using the UC tool toggle list.
+ **Normal Mode**: The user profile and contacts are visible as well as it being possible to switch between the *Chats, Telephony, Call History,* and *Phone Book* tools.
+ **Mini Mode**: Only a single area is visible and the UC tool selector menu is now found under the content area. Using the selector tool, it is possible to navigate through all UC tools, changing the visible content area as you go.

![Client Normal and Mini Mode](normal_mini_mode.en.png)

In order to simplify switching the various views, it is possible to toggle the sizes using a [shortcut key]({{< relref "#shortcut-keys">}}) if you choose to.

### Transfer

#### Blind Transfer (Unattended Transfer)

![Blind Transfer](blind_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

A blind or unattended transfer is a transfer of a call from one party to another without talking to the new contact during the transfer. A blind transfer can be performed at anytime during a call by clicking on the 'Transfer' icon and dialing the new destination number (number to which the call should be transferred).

If you wish to transfer the call to an internal colleague, simply right click on the desired colleague's name / profile picture in the contact list and select *Transfer* from the menu.

#### Attended Transfer

To transfer a call having spoken to the party to whom the call should be transferred, please follow these steps:

1. Click *Add Participant*, to talk to the new party.
2. Now *Transfer* the caller with the newly added participant.

![Attended Transfer](attended_transfer.en.png?width=100%)

It is not necessary to place the caller on hold, as this is automatically done when the call to the new participant in step 1 is started either via the *Add Participant* button, the contact list, the phone book or via the call history logs. After completing step 2, the caller will be connected to the new party.


### 3-Way-Conferencing

![3-way-conferencing](3_way_conference.en.png)

2. To start a 3-way-conference simply click on the *Conference* button.

During a 3-way-conference call it is possible for the initiator to remove a party from the conference directly from the active calls list in the telephony section of the desktop app.

### Sending DTMF Tones

DTMF tones are used to enter information via the dialpad such as PIN authentication for conference rooms or when selecting the required choice in an options menu (press 1 for..., 2 for ..., 3 for ... etc) or even having to enter a number code to open an intercom door for example.

For the pascom Client to send DTMF tones, the pascom softphone is required and the DTMF tones can be sent during a call via the *Dialpad*.

![DTMF](dtmf.en.png?width=70%)

The pascom desktop client includes an extensive search tool which can be accessed via the magnifying glass icon. When searching, the search tool will search all connected phone books, the call history and the chat archive. The search term can consist of multiple terms / words.
