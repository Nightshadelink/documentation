## Warning Notification

In the job box, a warning notification will appear as below:

    CRITICAL: A dialplan loop was detected, see /tmp/.dialplan-loop-detected

Under */tmp/.dialplan-loop-detected* a file will have been written that contains details on which extension the Dialplan Loop was caused.

## Recommended Steps

In order to avoid Dialplan loops occuring more often, you will find further information in the file regarding the affected extensions and you can then edit your call flow accordingly.

The notification will only disappear once the file *.dialplan-loop-detected* has been removed (either deleted or moved). To do this log into the pascom phone system via SSH.
