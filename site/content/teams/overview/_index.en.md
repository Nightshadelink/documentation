## Concept

Each [pascom VoIP phone system](https://www.pascom.net/en/) user has their own extension, devices and actions which control calls to their extension. **Additionally,** users can also be members of a team.

The **Team** also has its own specific extension and actions. Should a team extension be called, all member telephones will ring according to the configured call strategy and actions.  

{{% notice info %}}
If a team is called, the team actions apply exclusively. Actions configured for the user will be ignored in this scenario.
{{% /notice %}}

As such, it is possible to control, for example, that Frank remains available under his direct extension **22** even **outside of business hours** but calls to the support team after 18:00 are forwarded to the **voicemail box**.
