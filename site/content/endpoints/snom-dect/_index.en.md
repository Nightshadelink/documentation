## Overview

[Snom M700] (https://www.snom.com/ip-phones/workplace-mobility/m700-multi-radio-base-station/ "Snom DECT Workplace mobility solutions") base stations can be operated in both Single Cell and Multi-Cell deployments and are compatible with pascom cloud, hardware and virtual phone systems. As such the Snom M700 is ideally suited for organisations that require additional [work place mobility] (https://www.pascom.net/en/features/ "pascom workplace mobility features") over multiple floors or across larger company buildings.

### Available Channels

### Preparation

For the automatic provisioning of Snom DECT systems, a functioning DHCP server is required

## Configuration

Connect all required Snom base stations to your network. Once the boot process is completed, base stations will automatically appear in the PBX web UI Gateway list ('Gateways' > 'Gateway list').

The **Status** field currently has no relevance and the "plug symbol" warning is normal at this stage.

### Configuring Multi-Cell Operation

Should you wish to network multiple Gateways into a multicell DECT system, simply mark and select all the desired Gateways and click **Edit**. By using the arrow buttons, you can navigate through all your selected Gateways and then edit them as follows:

Under the {{< ui-button "Mutli Cell" >}} option, select the value {{< ui-button "Base Station" >}} for one of the Gateways and for all other Gateways, select the option {{< ui-button "Repeater" >}}.

### Add / Assign Handsets

Under {{< ui-button "Devices" >}} > {{< ui-button "Device List" >}} > {{< ui-button "Add" >}}, select the option {{< ui-button "Via Snom DECT Gateway: handset" >}}

ÃŒn the next screen, you will be able to configure the device and under the {{< ui-button "Assignment" >}} tab you will be able to assign users and / or locations.
