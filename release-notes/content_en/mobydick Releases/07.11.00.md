**Important notice about this update:**<br/>
The prompt system has been completely rebuilt. The migrations process performs a full back and stores your existing prompts in /BACKUP/oldprompts_done.tgz before updating. However, you should check in Advanced -> prompts that they are listed after updating and if not then use the back up to restore your prompts as while it is unlikely during the migrations process, some prompts may not be migrated.
