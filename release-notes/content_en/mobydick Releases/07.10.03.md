Anyone who has configured the authentication process to be performed against an external LDAP - Server will need to reconfigure this after updating to 7.10.03. This is because a few parameters have been modified in this version and the older settings can not be automatically migrated. Should these settings not be reconfigured after updating, then users who are setup using the authentication method "EXTERNAL" will no longer be able to log into the mobydick client!
