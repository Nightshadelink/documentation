**2. Dynamic conference rooms are no longer available**<br/>
Due to the switch from Meetme to the new Conf_Bridge,  the dynamic conference rooms functionality has been temporarily removed.<br/>
**3. Installation on mini.Appliance**<br/>
Please be aware that the installation process on the mobydick mini.Appliance may take more than 30min. Even if you can see the login screen, the installation might still be in process.
