The mobydick cloudstack basically consists of three components:

## Management-UI

Via the cloudstack Management-UI, you can manage your mobydick and Proxy Instances as well as creating backups and updating the whole system.

## Proxy Instances

mobydick Instances are never reachable directly but rather only via a Proxy.

This has two Benefits:

1. The Proxy acts as a security layer and only permits access to individual mobydick instances as authorised by you.

2. The Proxy requires only an IP address. All mobydick instances that lie "behind" the proxy are addressable through entering the mobydick instance name.

## mobydick Instances

Every customer will be assigned with their very own mobydick instance, meaning it is possible to imagine the instances as tenants.

The Instances are not directly accessible but rather only via a Proxy.
Further details can be found [Proxy Instances](../proxy-instances/).
