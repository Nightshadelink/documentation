The Cisco SPA112 and SPA122 ATA adapters are ideal for connecting analog end-points to your mobydick instance (e. g. Fax, Door Intercoms, etc.)

## cloudstack Compatibility

|---|---|---|---|

These ATA adapters can be securely (TLS, SRTP) operated on a cloudstack instance. However, they currently do not support automatic configuration (provisioning) or management (firmware updates.

## Configuration

In our example setup, we are using the following configuration data:

* Proxy DNS Name: `mobydick.example.com`
* mobydick Instance Name: `pascom`

### mobydick Instance

#### Add Device

Log into the appropriate mobydick instance `https://mobydick.exmaple.com/pascom` and under `Devices > Device List` add a new device from using the  **IP-Telephone: Any Manufacturer or Softphone**.

Modify the `Device Login` name or use the automatically generated name.
Take note of the login credentials including `password` which in our example are as follows:

* Device Login: `cisco_1`

#### Add User

Under `Users > User List` add a new user and assign them with the device `cisco_1`. For example:

* Login Name: `fax_og`
* Extension: `100`

#### Apply Jobs

After saving the above changes, a job entry will appear in the Job Box (center top of screen) which will need to be applied. Start the job by clicking on the `green tick`.

### ATA Adapter
{{% notice tip %}}
Our configuration recommendations are based on the assumption of a device with factory settings. To be sure, please reset your device to factory settings before continuing with the configuration. This can be done holding the device **Reset** button for a minimum of **10 seconds**.
{{% /notice %}}

#### Log into the Web UI

Log into the ATA adapter web UI. The adapter automatically obtains an IP address per DHCP and the standard username and password are `admin`, `admin`.

The simplest way to determine the IP address is with the help of an analog device.
Connect the device to the adapter's **Phone 1** port and dial `****`.

Now by entering `110#` you will be able to request the IP address.

Should you not have an analog telephone, then please refer to your DHCP server logs or use a Network scanner such as nmap to determine which IP address the adapter received.

## Test

### ATA Adapter Status

To check the state of the ATA Adapter go to `Voice > Information`. Under the option **Line 1 Status**,
**Registration State** the value should read **Registered** .

### Test Call

To test your analog endpoint, simply call `*100` using the device. You should hear the mobydick voicemail box announcement. Moreover, in our example the analog device is now reachable under the extension number `100`. You should also call the extension in order to test incoming calls.
