The cloudstack management web UI provides you with a platform to manage all [pascom VoIP phone systems] (https://www.pascom.net/en/documentation/mobydick/server/accessing-mobydick/ "pascom IP Telephony Platform access") and can be accessed using the **admin** password for the cloudstack Web UI and SSH access. Before proceeding, the **admin** password should be changed which cannot be done via the web UI and therefore requires SSH access.

In our example, we are using the following configuration data:

* Management DNS Name: `mobydick-trusted.example.com`

## Password Changes

### Login per SSH

Login in to the cloudstack via SSH:

```
ssh admin@mobydick-trusted.example.com
```

and become root:

```
sudo -s
```
### Change the Admin SSH Password

Use the following command to change the Admin SSH password:

```
passwd admin

```

and follow the on-screen instructions:
```
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```

### Change the Management UI Admin Password

Use the following command to change the Web UI Admin password:

```
lxc-attach -n controller -- /opt/csmanager/manage.py changepassword admin
```
and follow the on-screen instructions:
```
Changing password for user 'admin'
Password:
Password (again):
Password changed successfully for user 'admin'
```
