This HowTo demonstrates how to gain shell access to individual mobydick instances. This is particularly useful for debugging services belonging to a particular instance (e.g. Asterisk).

## Access

Direct SSH access to a mobydick instance is not possible. Therefore, you will need to proceed as follows:

### SSH Access to the cloudstack

First log into the your cloudstack per SSH using the **same password as for the
Management-UI**:

    ssh admin@mobydick.example.com

become the root user:

    sudo -s

and enter the password:

    [sudo] password for admin:

### List Containers

Each mobydick Instanc runs as a Linux Container. You can review a list of all available containers as follows:

    lxc-ls -f


```
 NAME           STATE   AUTOSTART GROUPS IPV4                    IPV6
 controller     RUNNING 0         cs     10.0.3.167              -
 pascom         RUNNING 0         cs     10.0.3.150              -
 pg             RUNNING 0         cs     10.0.3.114              -
 proxy          RUNNING 0         cs     10.0.3.101              -
 ```

pg and controller are System Containers. mobydick and Proxy Instances use the names as entered in the Management-UI as Container Names.

In our example, `pascom` is a mobydick Instance.

### Accessing a mobydick Instance

Now you directly access a mobydick instance as follows:

    lxc-attach -n [Container-Name]

For example:

    lxc-attach -n pascom


Open a mobydick instance in a new shell container:

    root@pascom:/#

### Accessing the Asterisk CLI

A common request is to have access to a mobydick instances Asterisk CLI, particularly for debugging purposes. Once logged into the container, you can access the CLI using the following syntax:

    asterisk -r

```

### Logging out of a mobydick Instance

Once you have finished working on this container, you will be able to leave (log out) of the container by issuing the following command:

    exit
