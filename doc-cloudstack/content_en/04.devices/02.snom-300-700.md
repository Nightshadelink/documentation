\* A direct remote controlling of Snom Telephones is only possible whe the cloudstack can reach the telephones directly per IP. This should not be the case in most cloudstack installations as the telephones are located on site behind a NAT.

An indirect remote controlling is possible: click on **dial** in the mobydick client for example and the telephone will then be invited to the conversation and you must pick up the received in order to build the connection to the desired destination.

## Configuration

During the configuration, we use the following example data:

* Proxy DNS Name: `mobydick.example.com`
* mobydick Instance Name: `pascom`
